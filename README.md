# CyberShield - E-commerce Website Verification Tool

## Overview
CyberShield is a static web application built using Bolt.New AI to verify e-commerce websites for authenticity and security. Users can input a website URL to check whether it is a **trusted seller** or a potential scam. The app is designed to help consumers make informed decisions while shopping online.

## Features
- **Static Website Verification**: Users enter a website URL, and the tool determines whether it is a trusted seller or not.
- **Trust Score System**: Websites are classified as **trusted** or **potentially unsafe** based on predefined criteria.
- **Simple UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface for quick verification.
- **Predefined Results**:
  - Example: [Pimpom Store](https://www.pimpomstore.com/) ‚Üí **Negative (Not Trusted Seller)** ‚ùå
  - Example: [Nu Republic](https://www.nurepublic.co/) ‚Üí **Positive (Trusted Seller)** ‚úÖ

## Deployment
The application is deployed on **Netlify** and can be accessed at:
üëâ [CyberShield Web App](https://cozy-entremet-e5ad9b.netlify.app/)

## Future Enhancements
- **AI-Based Fraud Pattern Detection**: Implement machine learning models to analyze patterns in fraudulent websites.
- **Direct Integration with Platforms**: Collaborate with **Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce** to provide verified seller badges directly, eliminating the need for users to copy and paste links.
- **Browser Extension**: Develop a Chrome/Firefox extension for real-time verification while browsing.
- **User Reports & Community-Driven Insights**: Allow users to report scam websites and improve database accuracy.

## How It Works
1. Visit the CyberShield website.
2. Enter the e-commerce site URL in the input field.
3. Click the **Verify** button.
4. Receive instant feedback on whether the site is **trusted** or **potentially unsafe**.
